- 👋 Hi, I’m @motopascyyy
- 👀 I’m interested in building software which helps people get their work done faster and with less stress. My experience is in enterprise software which is often terrible. It can be so much better and help so many people. Let's make that happen!
- 🌱 I’m playing around with the Spring Framework, having used Spring Boot, Spring REST, Spring Data JPA and Spring Batch.
  - Next on the learning list:
    - Spring Security
    - Elloquent JavaScript
    - ReactJS
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment
- 📫 How to reach me - here or on StackOverflow by the same name.
